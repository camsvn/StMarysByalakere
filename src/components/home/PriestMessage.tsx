                We believe that God has blessed each of us with unique gifts, meant to be used in service of His Kingdom here on earth. At St. Mary's, there are many ways to share those gifts and become an active part of our faith community.
              </p>
              <p>
                We invite you to explore our website and learn more about the life of our parish. We hope you'll discover where God may be calling you to get involved.
